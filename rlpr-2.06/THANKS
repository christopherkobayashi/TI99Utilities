Several people were particularly helpful in getting rlpr out the door;
in particular, thanks to Diane Davidowicz for motivating me to
actually finish it and for testing it on several operating systems.
Also, thanks to Dan Stromberg and Jose Santiago for testing out
earlier non-public betas and sending back detailed snoop traces, and
Alain Nissen for tracking down down a number of pernicious bugs.
Thomas Sefzick also helped get me get rlpr working under Digital Unix
and found an number of portability bugs.  Thanks also go out to the
myriad nameless who have sent in patches and suggestions over the
years: rlpr has met my personal needs for years; at this point, its
future direction is driven by its users.
