TODO list
---------

* write an autoconf test for the last arguments to getsockopt() and
  getsockname().
* upgrade development environment past automake 1.4 and autoconf 2.13;
  see if any custom macros can go away.
* alert user as to number of copies being made?
* flag for just doing `direct from stdin' for platforms that can support it?
* add back SYSLOG_UNUSABLE code if it turns out it's still needed.
* any way to interpret errors from lpd, even hueristically?!
* maybe control-c should be bound such that it attempts to abort the job?
* inetd support for rlprd
* use ChangeLog
* fix ultrix and seteuid
* write automated regression testsuite
* multiple timeout values (connect/write/read?)
* support writeback for hpux
* fix `version' so that any recompiled file will result in an updated version
  string.
* some lpd's require that the hostname provided with H be a lowercase
  FQDN (even though this is not in the spec); consider adding support.
* aliasing feature for printer names?
