These files were taken verbatim from the GNU C Library.

This directory contains source for functions which are occasionally
missing from popular Unix variants.  These functions will *not* be
used if your system includes support for them already, with the
following exceptions:

	* xmalloc(), xstrdup(), xstrtol() and xstrtoul(), since these
          are not standard functions.

        * Any functions you explicitly request to be used.  This is
          useful when a function on your system is known to be buggy -
          for instance, old releases of Solaris are known to have a
          buggy alloca().  In general, you can count on autoconf to
	  do a good job figuring out whether you need these routines.
	  However, if you want to outsmart autoconf, merely edit the
	  `config.h' in the main distribution directory.

In general, you shouldn't have to worry about these details -- just
let autoconf take care of everything.
