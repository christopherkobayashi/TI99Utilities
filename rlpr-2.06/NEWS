* fixed rlpr to not expect an argument with --windows (nee -W) option.
* fixed `bsdlinks' target to not accidentally remove lprm.

Changes in release 2.03:

* added support for printer alternation in check-server.sh.
* fixed message displayed when incorrect non-long style options are
  passed to rlpr, rlpq, rlprd, or rlprm.

* fixed build problem that caused libnsl and libsocket (when required)
  not to appear on link line.
* new autoconf macros for EXIT_FAILURE/EXIT_SUCCESS.
* fixed two bugs in rlprrc lookups of hosts for a printer.
* fixed bug which prevented rlprrc lookups for a printer for a host
  (now, default to `lp' is only done when the rlprrc lookup fails).

* new hooks for internationalization support
* build procedure now uses automake in addition to autoconf
* remote printing commands now support a --timeout option in case
